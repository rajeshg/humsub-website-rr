# Code Style Guide

Always add comments.

# Typescript

- Always use TypeScript.
- We should avoid using `any` or `as` as much as possible. Prefer `unknown` if we have to do something like this.

# React

- Always use React functional components.
- Always use the latest version of React.

# React Router

This project uses React Router v7.
React Router v7 provides roughly the same functionality as Remix.
The module name is "react-router".

# CSS

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Do not use inline styles unless necessary
