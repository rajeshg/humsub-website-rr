# Essential React Router Tips

React Router is a powerful library for handling routing in React applications. Here are some essential tips to make the most of it.

## Use Data Loading Patterns

```tsx
// Example of a loader function
export async function loader({ params }) {
  const data = await fetchData(params.id);
  return { data };
}
```

## Handle Loading States

Always consider loading states in your routes. React Router provides built-in support for this through the `useNavigation` hook.

## Keep Routes Flat

While nested routes are powerful, keeping your route structure flat when possible makes it easier to maintain and debug.
