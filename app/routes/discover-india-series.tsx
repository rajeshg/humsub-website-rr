        <h2>The Indian spice story</h2>
        <p>
          Spices have long been intertwined with India's trade history. Black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon
          were highly valued in Europe and eventually drove the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama to land on the shores
          of India. What is it about these spices that made them so valuable? How have spices shaped traditional
          regional Indian cuisine? Dive into the aromatic sea of Indian spices at this talk and walk out with a “secret”
          recipe or two!
