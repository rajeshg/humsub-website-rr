				<h2>The Indian spice story</h2>

					of India. What is it about these spices that made them so valuable? How have spices shaped traditional
					regional Indian cuisine? Dive into the aromatic sea of Indian spices at this talk and walk out with a “secret”
					recipe or two!

				<h2>Breath, Mindfulness, and Gut health: Your path to wellbeing</h2>
				<p>
					Mindfulness emphasizes being fully present in the moment, observing thoughts and feelings without judgment,
					and responding to situations with awareness. Decades of neuroscience studies show the power of mindfulness to
					relieve stress, awaken our positive capacities, and bring balance to our lives. Mindfulness gives us the power
					to meet any situation wisely, to be fully present, and to operate with compassion.

					Did you know that the gut is often called the “second brain”? In this session, we’ll dive into the fascinating
					world of gut health, exploring how the gut-brain connection impacts overall well-being. Discover how daily
					choices—like food, stress management, and lifestyle—affect your gut, and learn simple, effective ways to
					restore balance. Walk away with practical insights to nurture your gut and boost overall well-being.

				<h2>Indian Marriage Traditions</h2>

					heart of an Indian wedding set in a traditional “mandap” or focal area of the festivities.

				<h2>Kolam Art</h2>
				<p>
					Kolams are beautiful patterns made up of lines that flow through and around grids of dots made of rice flour
					which are then joined to take the form of a symmetrical shape or a regular polygon. Traditionally drawn by
					women on the threshold of a house or business as a symbol of auspiciousness, the kolam is considered as the
					meeting point of the internal and the external. Each dot, line, curve, interlinking design, circle, triangle,
					and square, has a symbolic value representing the basic energies of the universe. In kolams, no dot is left
					unconnected or hanging. The grid of dots is based on the Fibonacci series and algebraic and numeric principles
					and the kolam epitomizes geometrical properties of symmetry, periodicity, and recursion. Join our kolam
					artists to learn more!
