			<h1>Youth Ambassador</h1>
			<p>
				A key focus area for Hum Sub in recent years has been Youth Leadership. This year, we are evolving our Youth
				Ambassador (YA) Program to a two-year internship, open to 9th and 10th graders. The goal is to provide a
				platform for growing young minds for community engagement to promote Indian culture and heritage in the Triangle
				area and beyond, as well as enhance their personal/professional development skills by engaging them in the
				planning, management and decision-making processes. The broad vision here is to bring in new energy and
				knowledge to Hum Sub's mission and vision, as well as contribute to positive youth development at an early age
				and help youth grow into engaged and responsible leaders in the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those selected for this program should have had some volunteering experience at Hum Sub events in the past years
				or have volunteering experience with other local organizations. In keeping with our efforts to be diverse and
				inclusive, we will also open up the program to youth of non-Indian origin to serve as Youth Ambassadors.
