                Lights held in October each year), Basant Bahar (festival of spring,
                held in spring each year) and other cultural events. Since its
                inception, Hum Sub's primary focus has been to promote, support and

                agencies and other cultural organizations. Hum Sub also works
                hand–in–hand with the Town of Cary. Our programs include stage
                performances, cultural exhibits, craft sales, feature cuisine from
                local Indian restaurants and have showcased vendors from the Triangle

            <h1>Vision & Mission</h1>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>
                To share the wide, varied culture and heritage of India with the
                communities of the North Carolina Triangle area and beyond through
                family-oriented cultural events geared toward learning, diversity
                awareness and inclusivity while helping to build a stronger foundation
                for our next generation.
            </p>

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Hum Sub's mission is to spread awareness of the social and cultural
                traditions of India in the Triangle area and beyond. We do so by
                promoting, supporting and organizing family-oriented events throughout
                the year that generate greater cultural awareness to build a foundation
                of inclusivity, harmony and appreciation of the value of diversity
                amongst our citizenry. Our focal areas include Youth Leadership,
                Community Outreach, Senior Citizen Inclusion just to name a few. We
                partner with local arts and cultural agencies, as well as with town
                governments, so that all our events and activities are easily
                accessible to the broader Triangle area and include and attract
                participation from the entire community. Through our yearly events and
                participation in community activities, we have become a regular fixture
                in the local cultural scene and have become the organization that
                represents Indian culture and heritage in the Triangle area.

            <h2>How it all began</h2>
            <p>
                The Hindi phrase "Hum Sub" means "All of us." Hum Sub, Inc. was founded
                in 2001 by a group of Indian Americans living in the Triangle area of
                NC, to address the growing need to share India's diverse and colorful
                cultural heritage with the local community at large.
            </p>

            <p>The founding families were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Poonam and Dr. Ajay Ajmani</li>
                <li>Mamta and Pradeep Bisarya</li>
                <li>Madhu and Inder Dev</li>
                <li>Pam and Dilip Gandhi</li>
                <li>Poonam and Gyan Gupta</li>
                <li>Bimal Shah</li>
                <li>Ritu and DK Singh</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The group wanted to increase awareness of Indian culture by organizing
                cultural events. Their idea was to bring the same level of
                professionalism that people exhibited at work to the organization and
                produce quality events. After their first successful sold-out event,
                Basant Bahar held at Green Hope High School, the group approached Lyman
                Collins, Cultural Arts Manager at the Town of Cary with the idea of
                organizing an event open to general public with the Town's partnership.
                Mr. Collins embraced the idea and the first Cary Diwali was held with
                at Herb C. Young Community Center attracting a record crowd of over
                2500 people. Both the Town of Cary and Hum Sub realized that they would
                need a bigger venue the following year to host this event and the new
                Koka Booth Amphitheatre seemed like a good fit. Since then, both Basant
                Bahar and Cary Diwali have grown both in quality and popularity. Cary
                Diwali was renamed to Hum Sub Diwali in 2022 and is the Triangle's
                signature Indian event and the biggest free-to-attend event in the
                southeastern United States.
