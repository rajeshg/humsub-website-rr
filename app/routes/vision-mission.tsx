			<h1>Vision & Mission</h1>

			<section>
				<h2>Vision</h2>
				<p>

					area and beyond through family-oriented cultural events geared toward learning, diversity awareness and
					inclusivity while helping to build a stronger foundation for our next generation.

				<h2>Who we are</h2>
				<p>
					Hum Sub's mission is to spread awareness of the social and cultural traditions of India in the Triangle area
					and beyond. We do so by promoting, supporting and organizing family-oriented events throughout the year that
					generate greater cultural awareness to build a foundation of inclusivity, harmony and appreciation of the
					value of diversity amongst our citizenry. Our focal areas include Youth Leadership, Community Outreach, Senior
					Citizen Inclusion just to name a few. We partner with local arts and cultural agencies, as well as with town
					governments, so that all our events and activities are easily accessible to the broader Triangle area and
					include and attract participation from the entire community. Through our yearly events and participation in
					community activities, we have become a regular fixture in the local cultural scene and have become the
					organization that represents Indian culture and heritage in the Triangle area.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hum Sub strives to promote greater awareness of the Indian social and cultural traditions through annual
					celebrations of Diwali (Festival of Lights held in October each year), Basant Bahar (festival of spring, held
					in spring each year) and other cultural events. Hum Sub relies entirely on community support and local
					business sponsorships to make its programs and events possible. For its activities, Hum Sub collaborates with
					local agencies and other cultural organizations besides working hand–in–hand with local towns. Our programs
					include stage performances, cultural exhibits, a wide variety of cuisines from local Indian restaurants and
					craft sales from showcased vendors across the NC Triangle area and nearby states.

				<h2>How it all began</h2>
				<p>
					The Hindi phrase "Hum Sub" means "All of us." Hum Sub, Inc. was founded in 2001 by a group of Indian Americans
					living in the Triangle area of NC, to address the growing need to share India's diverse and colorful cultural
					heritage with the local community at large.
				</p>
				<p>The founding families were:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Poonam and Dr. Ajay Ajmani</li>
					<li>Mamta and Pradeep Bisarya</li>
					<li>Madhu and Inder Dev</li>
					<li>Pam and Dilip Gandhi</li>
					<li>Poonam and Gyan Gupta</li>
					<li>Bimal Shah</li>
					<li>Ritu and DK Singh</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The group wanted to increase awareness of Indian culture by organizing cultural events. Their idea was to
					bring the same level of professionalism that people exhibited at work to the organization and produce quality
					events. After their first successful sold-out event, Basant Bahar held at Green Hope High School, the group
					approached Lyman Collins, Cultural Arts Manager at the Town of Cary with the idea of organizing an event open
					to general public with the Town's partnership. Mr. Collins embraced the idea and the first Cary Diwali was
					held with at Herb C. Young Community Center attracting a record crowd of over 2500 people. Both the Town of
					Cary and Hum Sub realized that they would need a bigger venue the following year to host this event and the
					new Koka Booth Amphitheatre seemed like a good fit. Since then, both Basant Bahar and Cary Diwali have grown
					both in quality and popularity. Cary Diwali was renamed to Hum Sub Diwali in 2022 and is the Triangle's
					signature Indian event and the biggest free-to-attend event in the southeastern United States.
