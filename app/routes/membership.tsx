					<Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full">
						<AccordionItem value="faq-1">
							<AccordionTrigger>What's the difference between a ticket and membership?</AccordionTrigger>

						</AccordionItem>

						<AccordionItem value="faq-2">
							<AccordionTrigger>Can I just buy tickets instead of membership?</AccordionTrigger>
							<AccordionContent>
								Yes — single‑event tickets are available (often sold in person). Tickets grant event access only; membership adds priority
								and year‑round benefits.
							</AccordionContent>
						</AccordionItem>

						<AccordionItem value="faq-3">
							<AccordionTrigger>Can we get membership in person at an event?</AccordionTrigger>
							<AccordionContent>
								Yes. You can purchase membership at the event or in advance via our{" "}

						<AccordionItem value="faq-4">
							<AccordionTrigger>Is seating reserved for members?</AccordionTrigger>
							<AccordionContent>
								Seating is offered on a priority, first‑come first‑served basis for members. The front section is reserved for members.
								We recommend arriving early (around 5:30 PM) to take advantage of member seating.
							</AccordionContent>
						</AccordionItem>

						<AccordionItem value="faq-5">
							<AccordionTrigger>If I buy a membership, do I get tickets to events?</AccordionTrigger>

								Check the specific event page for details.
							</AccordionContent>
						</AccordionItem>

						<AccordionItem value="faq-6">
							<AccordionTrigger>I am a member — can I bring family members?</AccordionTrigger>
							<AccordionContent>
								Membership is per person. Adults (18+) need their own membership. You may{" "}
								<Link to="/membership/signup" className="text-blue-600 underline">
									purchase additional memberships
								</Link>{" "}

							<AccordionContent>
