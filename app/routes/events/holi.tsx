				Holi is an Indian festival of colors celebrated in spring time. It heralds the arrival of spring following the
				winter season. People play with colored powder, apply it to each other and is a true display of gender equality
				across socio-economic backgrounds. Holi brings people together to strengthen the secular fabric. It is a way to
				let go of all the lethargy from the winter season and bring in positive energy. Holi has gained popularity in
				cities across the US drawing crowds from all diverse backgrounds.
