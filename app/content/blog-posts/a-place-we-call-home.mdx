North Carolina—especially the Piedmont region and Research Triangle—has a large and growing Indian American population. Indian Americans are now an integral part of many communities across the state.

According to 2020 Census data, there were 59,567 people identified as “Asian Indian” in the combined statistical area of Raleigh-Durham-Cary. Indian Americans bring with them a rich cultural heritage, entrepreneurial spirit, and a deep commitment to education and civic life. They contribute a vast diversity of linguistic, cultural, and religious traditions to both our country and our state.

The mission of HumSub is to share the social and cultural traditions of India with residents of North Carolina, the Triangle area, and beyond.

This exhibit features artifacts on loan from members of HumSub, examining the impact of Indian Americans through the lens of cuisine, customs, costume (or dress), and local businesses.

The North Carolina State Capitol is proud to honor this community, which represents the dynamic nature of our state—a North Carolina Story.
