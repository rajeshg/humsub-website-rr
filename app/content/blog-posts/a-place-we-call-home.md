# A Place We Call Home

![A place we call home](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/a-place-we-call-home.jpeg)

North Carolina—especially the Piedmont region and Research Triangle—has a large and growing Indian American population. Indian Americans are now an integral part of many communities across the state.

According to 2020 Census data, there were **59,567** people identified as “Asian Indian” in the combined statistical area of Raleigh-Durham-Cary. Indian Americans bring with them a rich cultural heritage, entrepreneurial spirit, and a deep commitment to education and civic life. They contribute a vast diversity of linguistic, cultural, and religious traditions to both our country and our state.

The mission of **HumSub** is to share the social and cultural traditions of India with residents of North Carolina, the Triangle area, and beyond.

This exhibit features artifacts on loan from members of HumSub, examining the impact of Indian Americans through the lens of cuisine, customs, costume (or dress), and local businesses.

The North Carolina State Capitol is proud to honor this community, which represents the dynamic nature of our state—a North Carolina Story.

## Sara Elegance Story

### 1. Can you share the Sara Elegance story?

After moving to the US from Mumbai, I took a long pause in my career to focus on raising my family, spending nearly a decade as a stay-at-home mom. While I loved that chapter of life, I always felt a quiet longing to return to work and pursue something of my own. With a background in accounting and a deep love for Indian culture and craftsmanship, I wanted to build something that reflected who I am today—a blend of tradition, elegance, and modern ambition.

The turning point came during a family trip to Jaipur, a city that stole my heart with its rich heritage, textiles, vibrant colors, intricate craftsmanship, and timeless elegance of Rajasthani design. That experience reignited a spark in me. Inspired, I started a small clothing venture from home, focusing on Indian casual and partywear. What began as a modest collection quickly grew, thanks to the love and support of my family and community.

A small boutique with everyday ethnicwear and festive pieces quickly grew through word-of-mouth and personal referrals. I realized the deep emotional value Indian bridalwear holds—not just for brides, but for families and culture. That led me to evolve my brand into a boutique dedicated to Indian bridal fashion, where tradition meets elegance, and every piece tells a story.

Today, my boutique is a celebration of Indian heritage, thoughtful craftsmanship, and the dreams of modern women. Whether you're shopping for your big day, a festive gathering, or a unique piece that feels like home, I'm here to help you find something unforgettable.

### 2. When did you start your business and how and when did you get into the bridal outfits segment? How big/important is this segment to your business?

- I started my business in **June 2015**; my bridal segment started almost a year later.
- The bridal segment found me, in a way. A client who loved one of our outfits asked if I could create a custom bridal lehenga for her wedding. I said yes—and poured my heart into it. That project lit a spark. I realized how meaningful it was to be part of such a significant milestone in someone's life, and how much care brides were seeking in finding someone who understood their vision, especially when they were planning from abroad.
- The bridal segment is a key pillar of our business. Indian weddings are deeply rooted in tradition, and bridalwear plays a central role in that cultural expression. For us, it's not just about designing a lehenga—it's about creating an emotional experience for a bride who is often thousands of miles away from home, yet wants to stay connected to her roots.
- From there, I began offering more personalized bridal services—from custom consultations to curated accessories and full trousseau styling. It's become one of the most rewarding parts of the business—not just designing outfits, but helping brides feel seen, supported, and beautifully themselves on their big day.
- While bridalwear may not be our highest-volume category, it is certainly among the highest in terms of value, customization, and customer relationship depth. Brides often become long-term clients—returning for trousseau items, family events, or recommending us within their networks—which makes the bridal segment incredibly important to both our brand and our growth.
- We've also found that this segment allows us to work more closely with artisans on intricate, made-to-order pieces—reinforcing our mission of supporting traditional craftsmanship while delivering a deeply personal experience to each bride.

### 3. Who are your main clients?

I started with casual and partywear outfits, and soon discovered a growing need: many of my customers are Americans attending Indian weddings, Bollywood parties, or cultural festivals—all looking for something authentic, beautiful, and appropriate to wear.

That's when my boutique truly found its purpose.

Today, I specialize in helping people of all backgrounds feel confident and stunning in Indian attire. Whether it's an American bride marrying into Indian families, attending a first Indian wedding, a Diwali celebration, or a Bollywood night, my goal is to make Indian fashion approachable, elegant, and joyful for everyone. I'm here to guide you with warmth and care—from outfit selection to styling tips. Every piece in my collection is handpicked to reflect the rich traditions of India, while being accessible and wearable for all.

### 4. What are some of the challenges you have faced and how have you overcome them?

- Balancing traditional Indian craftsmanship with the expectations of U.S.-based clients—especially around quality, timelines, and trust. I overcame this by building strong relationships with reliable vendors, creating clear processes, and maintaining open communication with customers.
- Establishing credibility as a new brand. I focused on personalized service, transparent policies, and building trust through real testimonials. My accounting background helped me stay financially grounded while learning to take creative risks that moved the brand forward.
- One of the biggest challenges I faced was being diagnosed with cancer while running and growing my business. Managing my health, treatments, and recovery—while still supporting clients and keeping operations going—tested me in every possible way. But it also gave me a deeper sense of purpose and resilience.
- Each obstacle, every challenge including my personal health journey, taught me something valuable, made me stronger, and reminded me why I started this—to create something meaningful and help shape the business into what it is today.

### 5. Talk a bit about how you strive to provide all the little accessories that the bride and groom may need.

We believe that wedding styling goes far beyond just the main outfit—it's the little details that complete the look and make the day truly special. That's why we offer a thoughtfully curated range of accessories to complement both bridal and groom wear. From intricately embroidered dupattas and bridal jewelry sets to matching potli bags, safas, kalgis, and even custom stoles and juttis for grooms—we aim to be a one-stop destination for the full wedding ensemble.

Our goal is to remove the stress of piecing things together from multiple sources, especially for couples planning from abroad. We listen closely to the couple's vision and offer personalized styling support to ensure everything—down to the bangles, bindis, or buttons—aligns seamlessly with their outfits and overall theme.

It's those finishing touches that elevate the look, and we take pride in helping each bride and groom feel complete, confident, and culturally connected on their big day.

### 6. Any stories/anecdotes you would like to share...

One of the most unforgettable brides I worked with had recently lost her younger brother. As we designed her lehenga, she asked if his name could be embroidered on the tassels.

It was a small detail but deeply meaningful. She told me, "I want to feel like he's with me when I walk down the aisle."

My design team delivered it so beautifully. When she saw the final piece, she held the tassels, smiled through tears, and said, "Now it feels complete."

That moment reminded me that what we create isn't just clothing—it's memory, love, and healing stitched into every thread.

## Telugu Wedding

### Pre-Wedding Rituals

The Nischayathartham ceremony marks the formal announcement of the marriage. During this pre-wedding ritual, an auspicious date and time for the wedding are chosen in the presence of both families. The couple exchanges rings to signify their commitment, and the bride receives gifts of jewelry, clothes, and silverware from her future mother-in-law as a blessing. This ceremony is a symbolic beginning of the wedding journey, strengthening the bond between the two families.

![Auspicious date selection ritual](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/telugu-wedding-3.png)

A few days before the wedding, the Pellikuthuru and Pellikoduku ceremonies take place separately at the bride’s and groom’s homes. These rituals involve the application of naluga, a paste made from flour, turmeric, and aromatic oils, which is smeared on the body of the bride and groom. This is followed by a ceremonial bath using turmeric-infused water, symbolizing purification of the body and soul in preparation for the sacred union. These rituals are steeped in tradition and are accompanied by music, laughter, and blessings from family members.

![Family blessings during the ceremony](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/telugu-wedding-6.png)

### Wedding Day Rituals

On the wedding day, the Kanyadaan and Panigrahanam are central rituals where the bride’s parents offer their daughter to the groom in a deeply emotional ceremony. After washing the groom’s feet, the father of the bride places her hand in the groom’s, symbolizing trust and acceptance. The groom solemnly vows to love, respect, and protect his bride for life. Following this, the Jellakara-Bellam ritual takes place at the most auspicious time, where a paste of cumin (jeelakara) and jaggery (bellam) is placed on the couple’s heads, signifying their readiness to share life’s bitter and sweet moments together as a united pair.

![Kanyadaan ritual with foot washing](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/telugu-wedding-7.png)

![Couple during the ritual](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/telugu-wedding-10.png)

Soon after, the Mangalsutram ritual begins. The bride and groom change into traditional white or cream-colored outfits with red, green, or yellow borders. The sacred mangalsutram, a yellow thread with two gold pendants at the center, is blessed by family members before the groom ties it around the bride’s neck with three symbolic knots. These knots represent Manasa (thoughts), Vacha (speech), and Karmana (action)—signifying the union of the couple in mind, word, and deed. This is followed by Talambralu and Pradhanam, a playful interlude in the wedding. The couple showers each other with colored rice or pearls as mantras are chanted, gradually turning into a joyful game with both families participating. Then, in the Pradhanam, a gold ring is dropped into a pot of milk and rose petals, and the couple competes to find it first. This fun-filled moment adds laughter and excitement, celebrating the beginning of their journey together.

## Tamil Weddings  
*By Ramya Desikan*

Tamil Brahmin weddings, known for their grandeur and vibrance, are steeped in Vedic rituals.

### Pre-Wedding Ceremonies

- **Nakshatra Porutham (Horoscope Matching):**  
  Every traditional marriage in Tamil Nadu begins with matching the bride's and groom's horoscopes. The wedding proposal hinges critically on this step.

- **Panthakkaal Muhurtham (The Announcement):**  
  Family elders raise a decorated banana tree and place a tall wooden stick outside the house to announce the upcoming marriage. Prayers are offered for a smooth wedding.

- **Sumangali Prarthanai (Honoring the Deceased):**  
  Married women are invited to the bride's home and served a traditional feast to invoke the blessings of deceased sumangalis (women who died while their husbands were alive). This ritual honors the divine feminine energy and maintains ancestral continuity.

- **Vratham (The Fast):**  
  A day before the wedding, both families observe a fast and pray for the couple’s prosperity and happiness. Married women pour water into a clay pot filled with nine varieties of grains, allowing them to sprout throughout the day. The pot symbolizes the house, the grains the couple, and the sprouting signifies growth and prosperity.

- **Naandi Shraadham:**  
  Brahmin priests conduct rituals to invoke the blessings of family ancestors, who are offered gifts as a token of respect and gratitude.

- **Nichayatartham (Formal Engagement):**  
  The ritual begins with prayers to Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles. Gifts are exchanged between families, and the bride and groom don clothes gifted by their in-laws. Before exchanging rings, the groom's sister applies vermillion and sandalwood on the bride's forehead, and the bride's brother does the same for the groom. Garlands are also exchanged.

### Wedding-Day Rituals

- **Mangala Snanam (Ritual Bath):**  
  On the wedding morning, the bride and groom apply turmeric, vermillion, and oil to their bodies and take a ceremonial bath.

- **Gouri Pooja:**  
  The bride worships Goddess Gouri, seeking blessings for a prosperous and healthy married life.

- **Kashi Yatra:**  
  The groom theatrically threatens to become an ascetic and leave for Kashi (a revered pilgrimage site), but is persuaded by the bride’s father and relatives to fulfill his duties as a householder. This symbolizes the importance of each stage of life. The groom is then welcomed back into the marriage hall with great pomp.

- **Vara Pooja:**  
  The bride's family welcomes the groom's family with platters of fruits, nuts, clothes, and more.

- **Pada Pooja (Washing the Groom’s Feet):**  
  As the groom enters the mandap, the bride's father washes his feet with a mixture of holy water, vermillion, milk, and sandalwood, then dries them with flower petals. This sacred act reveres the groom as divine and the wedding as a holy rite.

- **Oonjal (Swing Ceremony):**  
  The couple sits on a wooden swing while women sing traditional songs. The swinging motion symbolizes the ups and downs of married life, supported by family blessings. Rice balls, milk, and banana are waved around them and offered to ward off evil and invoke prosperity.

- **Maalai Matral (Exchange of Garlands):**  
  The bride and groom exchange garlands offered by their maternal uncles, symbolizing the union of two souls.

- **Kannika Dhaanam (Giving Away the Bride):**  
  After the oonjal, the couple moves to the mandap. The bride sits on her father's lap holding a coconut, which they collectively hand over to the groom. The bride's mother sprinkles holy water on the coconut, and a holy thread is tied on their wrists.

- **Mangalya Dharanam (Tying the Sacred Thread):**  
  The groom ties the mangalsutra (a thick thread dyed in turmeric) around the bride's neck, tying three knots.

- **Saptapadi (The Seven Steps):**  
  The groom walks with the bride around the sacred fire, holding her right hand and right toe, helping her take seven steps. At each step, he recites a Vedic hymn invoking Maha Vishnu's blessings. Each step represents a vow: mutual nourishment, strength, prosperity, family, respect, spiritual growth, and lifelong friendship.

- **Ammi Midithu (Toe Ring Ritual):**  
  The bride steps on a grinding stone, symbolizing her resolve to remain steadfast through life's challenges.

### Post-Wedding Rituals

- **Gruhapravesha (Entry into the Marital Home):**  
  The newlyweds visit the groom's house, where his mother performs a traditional welcome. The bride enters her new home holding a lamp.

- **Valeyadal (Playtime):**  
  The groom's sister offers gifts to the bride, and the family plays traditional games to help the bride feel at home.

### Wedding Attire

- **Bride:**  
  Wears a 9-yard silk saree (madisaar) in auspicious colors like red, maroon, or gold, with traditional temple jewelry in gold and fresh jasmine flowers in her hair. A large red or maroon bindi adorns her forehead.

- **Groom:**  
  Wears a white silk veshti (unstitched cloth wrapped around the waist and legs) in traditional style, with an angavastram (matching silk shawl) over the shoulder. Some wear a second cloth (uttiriyam) across the torso during rituals. The sacred thread (poonal) is worn across the chest, and a mark of sandalwood paste or vermilion is applied to the forehead.

## Jain Wedding – *By Sejal Nanavati*

Jainism is one of the oldest religions in India, originating around the 6th century BCE. Its core principles of non-violence (ahimsa), non-possessiveness (aparigraha), and truthfulness (satya) also inform its marriage rituals.

### Pre-Wedding Rituals

1. **Vagdana (Sagaai / Engagement)**: Formal agreement between families, often in the presence of a Jain priest. Exchange of vows and gifts.
2. **Lagna Patrika (Wedding Invitation)**: The wedding date is fixed based on the Jain calendar, avoiding inauspicious periods.
3. **Mehendi & Sandhara (Optional)**: Mehndi as a cultural practice; Sandhara involves applying a paste of sandalwood and turmeric for purification.

### Wedding Day Rituals

4. **Snatra Puja (Purification Ritual)**: Ritual bath (abhishek) with holy water.
5. **Khol Barana / Aarti**: Welcoming the groom with a simple aarti.
6. **Granthi Bandhan (Sacred Knot Tying)**: The bride’s pallu is tied to the groom’s shawl.
7. **Havan (Optional)**: Symbolic havan (without fire).
8. **Pheras**: The couple walks around the sacred scripture (Shastra or Granth).
9. **Saptapadi (Seven Vows – Jain Version)**: Seven vows based on Jain principles.
10. **Kanyavaran and Varmalaa**: Giving away the bride and exchange of garlands.
11. **Ashirvada (Blessings)**: Elders and the Jain priest bless the couple.

### Post-Wedding Rituals

12. **Grahapravesh**: The bride enters her new home with a kalash (holy pot).
13. **Reception (Optional & Simple)**: Vegetarian feast, avoiding root vegetables.

#### Differences from Hindu Weddings

- No fire sacrifice—scripture is revered instead.
- No extravagant music/dance—focus is on spirituality.
- Strict vegetarianism—no alcohol, meat, or root vegetables.
- No strict astrological dependence.

![Jain wedding](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/jainwedding-1.png)

**Mehndi (henna)** is considered an adornment, much like jewelry. It is meant to enhance the bride’s beauty and is associated with happiness, love, and celebration. Mehndi is believed to bring good fortune to the couple. A dark stain is often said to signify a strong bond between the bride and her partner or mother-in-law. Henna has natural cooling properties, calming nerves and reducing stress before the big day.

## Maharashtrian wedding (By Shradha Joshi)

![alt text](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/maharastrian-wedding.png)

A Marathi wedding is a simple, traditional, and joyous affair. The wedding rituals combine poojas and vows that are all about celebrating love and having fun. Some of the characteristic rituals in Marathi weddings are Simant Poojan, Saptapadi, Kanpili, Vihinichi Pangat, and Sunmukh (explained below). The Rukhwat, very unique to Marathi weddings, includes a display of homemade arts and crafts along with a variety of sweets and snacks.

### How Does It Start?

Maharashtrian wedding ceremonies are rooted in Vedic tradition, so religion and family play an important role in them. There are a series of rituals that happen before the actual wedding day. A family priest looks at the horoscopes of the girl and boy to assess compatibility. Once he gives the nod, an auspicious wedding date and time is set. At the engagement ceremony, called Sakhar Puda, families exchange sugar packets and gifts of coins, sarees, and jewelry to accept the marriage officially, and the couple then exchange rings.
![alt text](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/maharastrian-wedding-1.png)

### Muhurta Karne

Post-engagement ceremony, the pre-wedding rituals go into full swing. The prep for the wedding starts months before the wedding day! Five married women, known as the 'suhasinis', are invited by the bride’s mother to come over on an auspicious day. Together, they grind turmeric with an iron pestle, to be used later, as well as pulses and spices, and roll flour papads.

### The Wedding Invitation

In a Marathi wedding, the first invitation is always offered to Lord Ganesha for his blessings. It is an integral part of the Marathi wedding traditions.

### Halad Chadhavne (Turmeric Ceremony)

The five suhasinis from the Muhurta Karne first apply turmeric paste with mango leaves on the groom's forehead, shoulders, hands, and feet. They then take the same paste to the bride and perform the same ritual.

### Chuda Bharne (Bangle Ceremony)

During this ceremony, the bride is given a set of green glass bangles, along with gold or pearl ones. In Maharashtrian culture, green is seen as a symbol of life, creation, and fertility. It is considered to be a lucky color that represents hopes for a newly married couple’s happy life. Once the bangles are worn by the bride, she is not allowed to leave the house until the day of the wedding.

### Ganpati Puja and Sod Munja

Two days before the wedding, the bride and groom offer prayers to Lord Ganesh for a smooth wedding ceremony. A very special ceremony also happens at the groom’s home only, which is known as Sod Munja. It marks the boy’s transition from boyhood to adulthood and is a significant rite of passage in Hindu tradition.

### Day of Wedding

In the morning, the bride and groom both get ready for the wedding at a pre-determined auspicious time. The most important rituals are Sankalpa, Kanyadan, Saptapadi, Sunmukh, and Vihinichi Pangat.

### Wedding Attire

The bride typically wears a rich silk saree or navvari (9-yard) with gold jewelry and a shela (stole) made from finely woven silk with heavy gold thread work. She is adorned with traditional gold necklaces and bangles. A traditional nose pin called nath, made from pearls and ruby, is a statement piece. The hair is usually done up in a bun on which are strings of fresh flowers. The bride also wears jodvi (toe rings).

The groom will don a heavily embroidered long tunic (kurta), dhoti, and a turban. They also wear a shela. Both bride and groom have the mundavalya, a holy ornamental thread that is tied around the heads of the bride and groom.

### Wedding Day Rituals

#### Varat

The groom typically rides on a horse to the venue to the accompaniment of a musical band and much dancing by family and friends.
![alt text](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/maharastrian-wedding-5.png)

#### Antarpat

After the groom arrives, the bride is also brought to the wedding enclosure by her maternal uncle. A silk curtain (the antarpat) is hung between the bride and groom while a priest chants some sacred prayers. This is done because the two are not supposed to look at each other until after the priest finishes his chanting.
![alt text](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/maharastrian-wedding-6.png)

#### Sankalpa

The bride and groom finally lay eyes on one another. The couple then exchange garlands and showers them with whole rice (akshata).

#### Kanyadan

In a ritual common to all weddings in India, the father of the bride gives away his daughter to the bridegroom with blessings. The groom accepts her and promises to love and respect his wife forever.
![alt text](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/maharastrian-wedding-7.png)

#### Lajahoma and Tying of the Sacred Thread (Mangalsutra)

This is a very important ritual in a Marathi wedding. During the Lajahoma, the bride offers grains to the havan, or holy fire, while chanting three mantras which the groom repeats. The fourth mantra is uttered silently only by the bride. Following this, the bride's parents worship the couple as avatars of Lord Mahavishnu and Goddess Mahalakshmi. The bride and groom then tie a turmeric thread on each other's hands, and then the groom ties the mangalsutra around the bride’s neck. Finally, he applies vermilion (sindoor) on her forehead.

##### Mangalsutra: The Sacred Thread of Marriage

The mangalsutra is the most important piece of jewelry for a Maharashtrian bride, representing love, commitment, and the sacred bond of marriage.

- **Traditional Design**: A chain with black beads and gold discs, believed to protect the couple from negativity.
- **Modern Adaptations**: Today, brides can choose from minimalist, diamond-studded, and lightweight mangalsutra designs.
- **Symbolism**: The two vatis (gold discs) represent Shiva and Shakti, signifying balance in marriage.

#### Saptapadi (The Seven Steps)
![alt text](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/maharastrian-wedding-9.png)
The couple takes seven rounds around the holy fire. The bride is required to touch seven betel nuts placed on top of small mounds of rice with her right foot. Once the seven rounds are done, she places her foot on a grindstone, while the groom holds her hand or foot, symbolizing that she needs to be strong and he will always support her.

#### Kanpili

The brother of the bride or the sibling of the bride playfully twists the ear of the groom, warning him to keep her happy and takes a promise that he will always take care of the sister and support her. The sibling then gets gifts from the groom’s side.

![alt text](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/maharastrian-wedding-10.png)

### Wedding Reception and Vihinichi Pangat

Once these rituals are completed, the couple is formally introduced to all the guests. The bride wears a saree that is gifted to her by the groom’s family, and the groom wears an outfit that the bride’s parents gift him. The unique aspect of this is a feast that is held for the mother-in-law of the bride. The mother-in-law is welcomed with flowers and served on a silver plate along with the bride and groom and immediate family members. The feast includes a variety of traditional dishes and at least five desserts.

![alt text](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/maharastrian-wedding-11.png)

### Laxmi Poojan

The wedding rituals come to an end with the Karmasamapti, wherein the couple offers prayers to Goddess Lakshmi. In some families, the groom will, at this point, give his bride a new name.

### Sunmukh

Literally meaning “bride's face,” in this symbolic ritual, the mother-in-law formally acknowledges and accepts her daughter-in-law into the family. She holds a mirror in front of her, and they all look at their reflection in the mirror.
![alt text](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home/maharastrian-wedding-12.png)

### Varat and Grihapravesh

The bride bids farewell to her parents, and the groom carries the idol of Goddess Parvati from Gaurihar Puja done earlier. Usually, a large procession follows the bride to her in-law's home. During the Grihapravesh, the newlywed couple is welcomed to the groom's family home. The groom's mother washes the couple's feet with milk and water and performs an aarti. Then, while entering the house, the bride is asked to push down a kalash (holy pot) of rice. Then, with her right foot forward, the bride enters her new home accompanied by her husband.

## Coorgi (Kodava) Wedding  
*By Priya Devviah*

Held amid the emerald hills of Coorg (Kodagu) district of Karnataka state, a Kodava wedding is more than a union—it is a jubilant tapestry woven from centuries-old traditions, vibrant rituals, and the joyous spirit of community. Every moment is a celebration of heritage, nature, and togetherness, reflecting the Kodavas’ deep reverence for their land, ancestors, and the sacred river Kaveri.

### Auspicious Beginnings

The festivities begin with heartfelt prayers to Kaveri Tai (the Kaveri river), Guru Karana (the founding forefather of a clan), and the elders, invoking blessings for the couple’s new journey. The elders of both families gather at the temple to set the wedding date, guided by the priest who inscribes the auspicious date and time for the marriage on the *lagna patrike* (the invitation, loosely).

The *Nischaya* (engagement ceremony) is a cherished affirmation that this marriage is a bond not just between two individuals, but between two families and their shared legacy.

### Rituals of Promise and Preparation

- **Poti-dumchudo**: At the bride’s home, loved ones pack her trousseau with colorful sarees, pots, and utensils as a symbolic send-off brimming with love and hope.
- **Karik muripa & boiling milk**: On the wedding morning, women from both families gather for cutting vegetables to make curry and boiling milk, marking the auspicious start of the celebrations.

### Dancing, Feasting, and Joyful Gatherings

- **Oorkuduva**: The Kodava version of the mehendi (henna) ceremony, is a riot of color and music. Family and friends adorn the bride and groom’s hands with henna, believing the deeper the stain, the stronger the love.
- The courtyard comes alive with the vigorous Kodava *aat*, a dance of pure celebration with no set pattern—just the exuberant rhythm of life itself.

### Rituals of Blessing

- **Bangle Ceremony**: The wedding day dawns with the bangle ceremony, where the bride’s aunt lovingly places bangles on her wrists, signifying her new beginnings.
- After ritual baths, the bride and groom don their traditional finery—each ornament and garment a tribute to their ancestry.

#### Traditional Attire

- **Groom**: White kupya and red chale (silk waist band), piche katti (dagger), odi kattis (war knife), are-cangole (waist chain), chain of gold beads and corals, thick bangles, a ring, and a turban covered with a red veil.
- **Bride**: Heirloom Pathak, kadaga (bracelet), sarapani (chain), karimani (string of black beads), chain of gold beads and corals, padaga, pilli, kalsara, gaggara (all these four are silver ornaments for the feet), rings, a sari, and a red veil.

- The bridegroom walks to the wedding enclosure or *muhurtham pandal*, holding a *gejje tand* (sacred wand) in his right hand symbolizing authority and tradition. His uncle (*bojakara*) holds an open umbrella covered with white cloth for him.

#### Bale Ketho (Banana Stem Cutting) Ceremony

- A row of nine or more banana stems, always in multiples of three, are placed with flowers on top.
- Maternal uncles of both the bride and groom are given the honor of cutting the banana plant stems. They walk around them thrice in a clockwise direction and then cut the stems, one after another, each with a single clean stroke.
- After this, they dance joyfully and the groom proceeds to the wedding stage or *mantap*. When the groom walks up the steps, rice is showered on his head by members of the bride's family.

#### Mantap Rituals

- On either side of the mantap, two *mukkalis* (small stools) are placed, each carrying a silver plate filled with rice, a golden lamp, and a *kindi* (traditional water vessel) filled with milk.
- The groom and the bride pray to the river Kaveri and sprinkle rice over the *tookh-bolcha* (sacred lamp) before taking their seats in the mantap.
- Family and friends come together to bless the couple. A little rice is taken with both hands from the plates kept on either side and the rice is sprinkled thrice on the bride's or groom's head. Then they offer milk from the kindi to the bride/groom. The bride and groom touch the feet of the elders for their blessings.

- The bride’s maternal uncle—a figure of trust and love—then gives her away and the playful *batte tadipo* ceremony unfolds. The girl's cousins refuse to let her go and the groom needs to convince them all that he would take good care of her. The gold coin given by the groom seals that guarantee.

#### Ganga Puja Ceremony

- In the evening is the Ganga puja ceremony, a ritualistic worship of water, representing the sacred river Ganga, which symbolizes purity, fertility, and divine blessings.
- In the Kodava tradition, this ritual honors water not just as a natural element but as a life-giver and purifier.
- The bride sprinkles some rice into a well thrice and prays. She breaks a coconut with the *piche katti*, and then draws water from the well and pours it into four small pots. She places two of the small pots of water, one on top of the other, over a circular pot-rest on her head. Two young women of the groom's family carry one pot of water each and walk with the bride, one in front of her and one behind her toward the mantap.

- In celebration, the families dance to the beat of the *valaga* (an ensemble of percussion instruments) and bring the night alive. Joy overflows with the celebration of abundance and togetherness.

### A Feast for the Senses

No Kodava wedding is complete without a lavish spread. Along with being a celebration of culture, weddings are a celebration of food and drinks too. Guests savor traditionally flavored dishes like:

- **Pandi curry** (a pork dish)
- **Kadambuttu** (steamed rice balls)
- **Noolputtu** (rice noodles)
- **Mango yogurt chutney**
- An array of sweets and savories, each bite a celebration of abundance and hospitality.

---

### A Homecoming and a New Beginning

The festivities culminate in *Ooral Kool*, as the bride is welcomed into her new home and showered with rice and blessings.

Every ritual, every dance, every shared meal is a testament to the Kodava belief that life’s greatest milestones are meant to be celebrated—together, in harmony with nature, and with hearts full of gratitude and joy. A Kodava wedding is a celebration that echoes through the hills of Coorg and the hearts of all who gather there.

## Weddings of Punjab – Sikh Weddings  
*By Gurleen Bajaj*

Sikh weddings, known as **Anand Karaj** (meaning “blissful union”), are a radiant celebration of love, faith, and family. Rooted in Sikhism’s core values—equality, devotion, and service—these weddings blend spiritual meaning with vibrant cultural traditions.

### Key Elements

- At the heart of the ceremony is the **Guru Granth Sahib**, the central religious scripture of Sikhism, revered as the eternal Guru. The entire wedding takes place in its presence, often inside a Gurdwara or Sikh place of worship.
- Everyone removes their shoes and covers their heads as a sign of respect. Many Sikhs also wear the Five Ks—symbols of faith and duty—such as the **kirpan** (a ceremonial sword) and **kara** (steel bracelet).

### Pre-Wedding Festivities

- The **roka** and **kurmai** mark the formal engagement.
- The joyous **jaggo night** lights up the neighborhood. Relatives carry copper pots with candles or oil lamps on their heads and dance to lively folk songs, filling the air with excitement and community spirit.

### The Wedding Day

- The bride and groom arrive at the Gurdwara in traditional attire.
  - **Groom**: Regal sherwani, adorned turban, and often carries a kirpan, reflecting valor and responsibility.
  - **Bride**: Dressed in red or pink, beautifully adorned with **chooda** (red and white bangles) and **kalire** (golden hanging ornaments tied by her sisters and friends).
- The **Anand Karaj** takes place as sacred hymns called **lavan** are sung, while the couple walks around the Guru Granth Sahib, each round representing a deeper spiritual bond. The atmosphere is serene yet joyful, centered on prayer and unity.

### Post-Wedding

- Following the ceremony, emotions run high as the bride bids farewell to her family during the **vidaai**. She throws puffed rice over her shoulder, symbolizing her gratitude and the blessings she leaves behind. It's a tender, heartfelt moment that marks both an ending and a new beginning.

Sikh weddings are not just about the union of two individuals—they are a beautiful tapestry of love, faith, and community, deeply rooted in centuries-old traditions and spiritual meaning.

## Wedding of Uttrakhand – Kumaoni weddings

Weddings in Uttarakhand are intimate and deeply spiritual, reflecting the cultural traditions of the Kumaoni and Garhwali communities amidst the serene backdrop of the Himalayas. Rituals such as the Kanyadaan and Phera are conducted with sacred chants echoing through the serene mountain air, often in the presence of local deities and ancestral blessings. Traditional folk songs like Mangal Geet are sung by the women of the house, creating a deeply emotional and communal atmosphere.

The emphasis on simplicity, authenticity, and cultural pride makes weddings in Uttarakhand not just a celebration of two souls, but a tribute to the land, its people, and age-old traditions. The Kumaoni bride wears a richly adorned Ghagra-Choli(long skirt) or saree in deep reds or maroons, symbolizing prosperity and fertility. Her look is completed with ornate gold jewelry, including the signature nath (nose ring), pichora (a saffron-colored dupatta with traditional patterns), and a mukut(tiara) each piece carrying cultural significance. The groom, on the other hand, dons a white or cream Kurta-Churidar or Dhoti-Kurta, paired with a mukut (crown) representing valor and tradition. Both bride and groom often wear tilak(religious mark) on their foreheads, making Kumaoni weddings both visually striking and culturally profound.

One unique and lighthearted ritual in a Kumaoni wedding is the unveiling of humorous puppets that mimic the in-laws from both sides. During the wedding preparations, the bride’s and groom’s families create playful look-alike figures of their future in-laws, highlighting their quirks in a fun and exaggerated way. The grand reveal takes place at the wedding venue, bringing laughter and joy as the traits of each in-law are humorously showcased, adding a touch of warmth and humor to the celebrations.

## Traditions of a Bengali Wedding
A Bengali wedding is a vivid celebration of culture, family, and love—where rituals meet revelry, and age-old customs are embraced with enthusiasm. Rooted in Hindu traditions but often adapted with modern touches, Bengali weddings typically span several days and are filled with meaningful ceremonies, delicious food, music, and vibrant clothing. Every stage—from courtship to the bride’s welcome into her new home—is woven with symbolism, storytelling, and the warmth of close-knit families.

The journey begins with Ashirbaad, the formal blessing of the bride and groom by their elders. Family members visit each other's homes to offer gold, rice, and blessings, signifying acceptance and auspicious beginnings. Then comes Gaye Holud, the turmeric ceremony held separately for the bride and groom. A paste made from turmeric, often sent from the bride’s or groom’s family, is applied to their skin to purify and beautify them before the wedding. This joyful, music-filled event is marked by laughter, bright yellow attire, and a festive spirit. Another heartfelt ritual is the Aiburobhaat, a special "last meal" given to the bride or groom in their parental home. It’s a symbolic send-off into married life, filled with traditional Bengali dishes and emotional blessings.

On the wedding day, the groom arrives with his entourage—Bor Jatri—dressed in traditional dhoti and topor, and is welcomed with Baran, a ritual involving rice, water, and aarti. The bride, adorned in a red Benarasi saree and gold jewelry, makes her grand entrance during the Saat Paak—she is carried on a wooden seat and circles the groom seven times, symbolizing their spiritual connection. She keeps her face hidden with betel leaves until the Shubho Drishti, when the couple exchanges their first look in front of the sacred fire and guests. This is followed by Mala Bodol, the playful exchange of floral garlands, and the Sampradan, where the bride’s guardian ceremoniously gives her hand to the groom, initiating the sacred vows and fire rituals (Hom).

After the wedding, the emotional Bidaay marks the bride’s farewell from her family home. She is welcomed into her new home with Bou Boron, where her mother-in-law greets her with traditional rituals. The next day is Bou Bhaat, the bride’s first meal in her new household, where the groom lovingly serves her food, marking his role as her partner and provider. This event often turns into a large family feast and a chance for both families to mingle more informally.

Bengali weddings are not just about rituals—they are about relationships. Each ceremony has a purpose: to honor ancestors, celebrate love, unite families, and bless the couple’s journey ahead. With conch shells echoing, uludhwani ringing through the air, and plates full of mishti doi and rosogolla, a Bengali wedding is a cultural tapestry that leaves lasting memories in every heart it touches.

## Choice of Wedding Venue

Choosing the right wedding venue is one of the most important decisions couples make. Popular options include hotel ballrooms, farms, and the Hindu Temple of North Carolina. Key considerations are the size of the gathering, the ability to use outside caterers, and facilities for traditional Indian wedding rituals.

For some, like Anuja Mathur, the venue (The Cotton Room) needed to have "character and feel different from a hotel ballroom." Others, such as Megha Bisarya, preferred the modern décor of a hotel (Crabtree Marriott), highlighting features like a spacious ballroom, charming outdoor patio for an intimate cocktail hour, and green areas for photos. Additional factors include:

- Space for a traditional wedding with a sacred fire
- Allowing late receptions
- Room for a baraat (ceremonial procession) and music
- Indoor and outdoor flexibility
- Proximity to the airport and the Triangle area for out-of-town guests

According to Anita Johnson, Catering Sales Manager at Sheraton Imperial Hotel & Convention Center, their venue is among the "top 5, even top 3, venues in the area." She notes, "The biggest selling point is our hotel size to accommodate larger weddings. The Sheraton did many Indian weddings back in the early 2000s, but they have become even more frequent since around 2015." She adds, "This segment is important because I admire the traditions families still practice, and the Indian population has grown so much in the last 10-15 years in our area."

**Anecdotes:**  
- One couple brought in the UNC Mascot for their reception, celebrating their alma mater.  
- Another couple walked down the aisle with their pet lab, delighting their guests.

**Testimonial:**  
> "Crabtree Marriott is a beautiful venue—we loved the modern décor throughout the hotel, the spacious ballroom for our wedding and reception, the charming outdoor patio for our cocktail hour, and the green areas for photos. Vanessa and the entire staff were a pleasure to work with, and the location was perfect for our out-of-town guests. Our special day couldn’t have been any better!"
