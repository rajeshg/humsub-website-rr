# A Place We Call Home

![A place we call home](/assets/blog/a-place-we-call-home.jpeg)

North Carolina—especially the Piedmont region and Research Triangle—has a large and growing Indian American population. Indian Americans are now an integral part of many communities across the state.

According to 2020 Census data, there were **59,567** people identified as “Asian Indian” in the combined statistical area of Raleigh-Durham-Cary. Indian Americans bring with them a rich cultural heritage, entrepreneurial spirit, and a deep commitment to education and civic life. They contribute a vast diversity of linguistic, cultural, and religious traditions to both our country and our state.

The mission of **HumSub** is to share the social and cultural traditions of India with residents of North Carolina, the Triangle area, and beyond.

This exhibit features artifacts on loan from members of HumSub, examining the impact of Indian Americans through the lens of cuisine, customs, costume (or dress), and local businesses.

The North Carolina State Capitol is proud to honor this community, which represents the dynamic nature of our state—a North Carolina Story.

## Sara Elegance Story

### 1. Can you share the Sara Elegance story?

After moving to the US from Mumbai, I took a long pause in my career to focus on raising my family, spending nearly a decade as a stay-at-home mom. While I loved that chapter of life, I always felt a quiet longing to return to work and pursue something of my own. With a background in accounting and a deep love for Indian culture and craftsmanship, I wanted to build something that reflected who I am today—a blend of tradition, elegance, and modern ambition.

The turning point came during a family trip to Jaipur, a city that stole my heart with its rich heritage, textiles, vibrant colors, intricate craftsmanship, and timeless elegance of Rajasthani design. That experience reignited a spark in me. Inspired, I started a small clothing venture from home, focusing on Indian casual and partywear. What began as a modest collection quickly grew, thanks to the love and support of my family and community.

A small boutique with everyday ethnicwear and festive pieces quickly grew through word-of-mouth and personal referrals. I realized the deep emotional value Indian bridalwear holds—not just for brides, but for families and culture. That led me to evolve my brand into a boutique dedicated to Indian bridal fashion, where tradition meets elegance, and every piece tells a story.

Today, my boutique is a celebration of Indian heritage, thoughtful craftsmanship, and the dreams of modern women. Whether you're shopping for your big day, a festive gathering, or a unique piece that feels like home, I'm here to help you find something unforgettable.

### 2. When did you start your business and how and when did you get into the bridal outfits segment? How big/important is this segment to your business?

- I started my business in **June 2015**; my bridal segment started almost a year later.
- The bridal segment found me, in a way. A client who loved one of our outfits asked if I could create a custom bridal lehenga for her wedding. I said yes—and poured my heart into it. That project lit a spark. I realized how meaningful it was to be part of such a significant milestone in someone's life, and how much care brides were seeking in finding someone who understood their vision, especially when they were planning from abroad.
- The bridal segment is a key pillar of our business. Indian weddings are deeply rooted in tradition, and bridalwear plays a central role in that cultural expression. For us, it's not just about designing a lehenga—it's about creating an emotional experience for a bride who is often thousands of miles away from home, yet wants to stay connected to her roots.
- From there, I began offering more personalized bridal services—from custom consultations to curated accessories and full trousseau styling. It's become one of the most rewarding parts of the business—not just designing outfits, but helping brides feel seen, supported, and beautifully themselves on their big day.
- While bridalwear may not be our highest-volume category, it is certainly among the highest in terms of value, customization, and customer relationship depth. Brides often become long-term clients—returning for trousseau items, family events, or recommending us within their networks—which makes the bridal segment incredibly important to both our brand and our growth.
- We've also found that this segment allows us to work more closely with artisans on intricate, made-to-order pieces—reinforcing our mission of supporting traditional craftsmanship while delivering a deeply personal experience to each bride.

### 3. Who are your main clients?

I started with casual and partywear outfits, and soon discovered a growing need: many of my customers are Americans attending Indian weddings, Bollywood parties, or cultural festivals—all looking for something authentic, beautiful, and appropriate to wear.

That's when my boutique truly found its purpose.

Today, I specialize in helping people of all backgrounds feel confident and stunning in Indian attire. Whether it's an American bride marrying into Indian families, attending a first Indian wedding, a Diwali celebration, or a Bollywood night, my goal is to make Indian fashion approachable, elegant, and joyful for everyone. I'm here to guide you with warmth and care—from outfit selection to styling tips. Every piece in my collection is handpicked to reflect the rich traditions of India, while being accessible and wearable for all.

### 4. What are some of the challenges you have faced and how have you overcome them?

- Balancing traditional Indian craftsmanship with the expectations of U.S.-based clients—especially around quality, timelines, and trust. I overcame this by building strong relationships with reliable vendors, creating clear processes, and maintaining open communication with customers.
- Establishing credibility as a new brand. I focused on personalized service, transparent policies, and building trust through real testimonials. My accounting background helped me stay financially grounded while learning to take creative risks that moved the brand forward.
- One of the biggest challenges I faced was being diagnosed with cancer while running and growing my business. Managing my health, treatments, and recovery—while still supporting clients and keeping operations going—tested me in every possible way. But it also gave me a deeper sense of purpose and resilience.
- Each obstacle, every challenge including my personal health journey, taught me something valuable, made me stronger, and reminded me why I started this—to create something meaningful and help shape the business into what it is today.

### 5. Talk a bit about how you strive to provide all the little accessories that the bride and groom may need.

We believe that wedding styling goes far beyond just the main outfit—it's the little details that complete the look and make the day truly special. That's why we offer a thoughtfully curated range of accessories to complement both bridal and groom wear. From intricately embroidered dupattas and bridal jewelry sets to matching potli bags, safas, kalgis, and even custom stoles and juttis for grooms—we aim to be a one-stop destination for the full wedding ensemble.

Our goal is to remove the stress of piecing things together from multiple sources, especially for couples planning from abroad. We listen closely to the couple's vision and offer personalized styling support to ensure everything—down to the bangles, bindis, or buttons—aligns seamlessly with their outfits and overall theme.

It's those finishing touches that elevate the look, and we take pride in helping each bride and groom feel complete, confident, and culturally connected on their big day.

### 6. Any stories/anecdotes you would like to share...

One of the most unforgettable brides I worked with had recently lost her younger brother. As we designed her lehenga, she asked if his name could be embroidered on the tassels.

It was a small detail but deeply meaningful. She told me, "I want to feel like he's with me when I walk down the aisle."

My design team delivered it so beautifully. When she saw the final piece, she held the tassels, smiled through tears, and said, "Now it feels complete."

That moment reminded me that what we create isn't just clothing—it's memory, love, and healing stitched into every thread.

## Jain Wedding – *By Sejal Nanavati*

Jainism is one of the oldest religions in India, originating around the 6th century BCE. Its core principles of non-violence (ahimsa), non-possessiveness (aparigraha), and truthfulness (satya) also inform its marriage rituals.

### Pre-Wedding Rituals

1. **Vagdana (Sagaai / Engagement)**: Formal agreement between families, often in the presence of a Jain priest. Exchange of vows and gifts.
2. **Lagna Patrika (Wedding Invitation)**: The wedding date is fixed based on the Jain calendar, avoiding inauspicious periods.
3. **Mehendi & Sandhara (Optional)**: Mehndi as a cultural practice; Sandhara involves applying a paste of sandalwood and turmeric for purification.

### Wedding Day Rituals

4. **Snatra Puja (Purification Ritual)**: Ritual bath (abhishek) with holy water.
5. **Khol Barana / Aarti**: Welcoming the groom with a simple aarti.
6. **Granthi Bandhan (Sacred Knot Tying)**: The bride’s pallu is tied to the groom’s shawl.
7. **Havan (Optional)**: Symbolic havan (without fire).
8. **Pheras**: The couple walks around the sacred scripture (Shastra or Granth).
9. **Saptapadi (Seven Vows – Jain Version)**: Seven vows based on Jain principles.
10. **Kanyavaran and Varmalaa**: Giving away the bride and exchange of garlands.
11. **Ashirvada (Blessings)**: Elders and the Jain priest bless the couple.

### Post-Wedding Rituals

12. **Grahapravesh**: The bride enters her new home with a kalash (holy pot).
13. **Reception (Optional & Simple)**: Vegetarian feast, avoiding root vegetables.

#### Differences from Hindu Weddings

- No fire sacrifice—scripture is revered instead.
- No extravagant music/dance—focus is on spirituality.
- Strict vegetarianism—no alcohol, meat, or root vegetables.
- No strict astrological dependence.

**Mehndi (henna)** is considered an adornment, much like jewelry. It is meant to enhance the bride’s beauty and is associated with happiness, love, and celebration. Mehndi is believed to bring good fortune to the couple. A dark stain is often said to signify a strong bond between the bride and her partner or mother-in-law. Henna has natural cooling properties, calming nerves and reducing stress before the big day.

## Coorgi (Kodava) Wedding  
*By Priya Devviah*

Held amid the emerald hills of Coorg (Kodagu) district of Karnataka state, a Kodava wedding is more than a union—it is a jubilant tapestry woven from centuries-old traditions, vibrant rituals, and the joyous spirit of community. Every moment is a celebration of heritage, nature, and togetherness, reflecting the Kodavas’ deep reverence for their land, ancestors, and the sacred river Kaveri.

### Auspicious Beginnings

The festivities begin with heartfelt prayers to Kaveri Tai (the Kaveri river), Guru Karana (the founding forefather of a clan), and the elders, invoking blessings for the couple’s new journey. The elders of both families gather at the temple to set the wedding date, guided by the priest who inscribes the auspicious date and time for the marriage on the *lagna patrike* (the invitation, loosely).

The *Nischaya* (engagement ceremony) is a cherished affirmation that this marriage is a bond not just between two individuals, but between two families and their shared legacy.

### Rituals of Promise and Preparation

- **Poti-dumchudo**: At the bride’s home, loved ones pack her trousseau with colorful sarees, pots, and utensils as a symbolic send-off brimming with love and hope.
- **Karik muripa & boiling milk**: On the wedding morning, women from both families gather for cutting vegetables to make curry and boiling milk, marking the auspicious start of the celebrations.

### Dancing, Feasting, and Joyful Gatherings

- **Oorkuduva**: The Kodava version of the mehendi (henna) ceremony, is a riot of color and music. Family and friends adorn the bride and groom’s hands with henna, believing the deeper the stain, the stronger the love.
- The courtyard comes alive with the vigorous Kodava *aat*, a dance of pure celebration with no set pattern—just the exuberant rhythm of life itself.

### Rituals of Blessing

- **Bangle Ceremony**: The wedding day dawns with the bangle ceremony, where the bride’s aunt lovingly places bangles on her wrists, signifying her new beginnings.
- After ritual baths, the bride and groom don their traditional finery—each ornament and garment a tribute to their ancestry.

#### Traditional Attire

- **Groom**: White kupya and red chale (silk waist band), piche katti (dagger), odi kattis (war knife), are-cangole (waist chain), chain of gold beads and corals, thick bangles, a ring, and a turban covered with a red veil.
- **Bride**: Heirloom Pathak, kadaga (bracelet), sarapani (chain), karimani (string of black beads), chain of gold beads and corals, padaga, pilli, kalsara, gaggara (all these four are silver ornaments for the feet), rings, a sari, and a red veil.

- The bridegroom walks to the wedding enclosure or *muhurtham pandal*, holding a *gejje tand* (sacred wand) in his right hand symbolizing authority and tradition. His uncle (*bojakara*) holds an open umbrella covered with white cloth for him.

#### Bale Ketho (Banana Stem Cutting) Ceremony

- A row of nine or more banana stems, always in multiples of three, are placed with flowers on top.
- Maternal uncles of both the bride and groom are given the honor of cutting the banana plant stems. They walk around them thrice in a clockwise direction and then cut the stems, one after another, each with a single clean stroke.
- After this, they dance joyfully and the groom proceeds to the wedding stage or *mantap*. When the groom walks up the steps, rice is showered on his head by members of the bride's family.

#### Mantap Rituals

- On either side of the mantap, two *mukkalis* (small stools) are placed, each carrying a silver plate filled with rice, a golden lamp, and a *kindi* (traditional water vessel) filled with milk.
- The groom and the bride pray to the river Kaveri and sprinkle rice over the *tookh-bolcha* (sacred lamp) before taking their seats in the mantap.
- Family and friends come together to bless the couple. A little rice is taken with both hands from the plates kept on either side and the rice is sprinkled thrice on the bride's or groom's head. Then they offer milk from the kindi to the bride/groom. The bride and groom touch the feet of the elders for their blessings.

- The bride’s maternal uncle—a figure of trust and love—then gives her away and the playful *batte tadipo* ceremony unfolds. The girl's cousins refuse to let her go and the groom needs to convince them all that he would take good care of her. The gold coin given by the groom seals that guarantee.

#### Ganga Puja Ceremony

- In the evening is the Ganga puja ceremony, a ritualistic worship of water, representing the sacred river Ganga, which symbolizes purity, fertility, and divine blessings.
- In the Kodava tradition, this ritual honors water not just as a natural element but as a life-giver and purifier.
- The bride sprinkles some rice into a well thrice and prays. She breaks a coconut with the *piche katti*, and then draws water from the well and pours it into four small pots. She places two of the small pots of water, one on top of the other, over a circular pot-rest on her head. Two young women of the groom's family carry one pot of water each and walk with the bride, one in front of her and one behind her toward the mantap.

- In celebration, the families dance to the beat of the *valaga* (an ensemble of percussion instruments) and bring the night alive. Joy overflows with the celebration of abundance and togetherness.

---

### A Feast for the Senses

No Kodava wedding is complete without a lavish spread. Along with being a celebration of culture, weddings are a celebration of food and drinks too. Guests savor traditionally flavored dishes like:

- **Pandi curry** (a pork dish)
- **Kadambuttu** (steamed rice balls)
- **Noolputtu** (rice noodles)
- **Mango yogurt chutney**
- An array of sweets and savories, each bite a celebration of abundance and hospitality.

---

### A Homecoming and a New Beginning

The festivities culminate in *Ooral Kool*, as the bride is welcomed into her new home and showered with rice and blessings.

Every ritual, every dance, every shared meal is a testament to the Kodava belief that life’s greatest milestones are meant to be celebrated—together, in harmony with nature, and with hearts full of gratitude and joy. A Kodava wedding is a celebration that echoes through the hills of Coorg and the hearts of all who gather there.

## Weddings of Punjab – Sikh Weddings  
*By Gurleen Bajaj*

Sikh weddings, known as **Anand Karaj** (meaning “blissful union”), are a radiant celebration of love, faith, and family. Rooted in Sikhism’s core values—equality, devotion, and service—these weddings blend spiritual meaning with vibrant cultural traditions.

### Key Elements

- At the heart of the ceremony is the **Guru Granth Sahib**, the central religious scripture of Sikhism, revered as the eternal Guru. The entire wedding takes place in its presence, often inside a Gurdwara or Sikh place of worship.
- Everyone removes their shoes and covers their heads as a sign of respect. Many Sikhs also wear the Five Ks—symbols of faith and duty—such as the **kirpan** (a ceremonial sword) and **kara** (steel bracelet).

### Pre-Wedding Festivities

- The **roka** and **kurmai** mark the formal engagement.
- The joyous **jaggo night** lights up the neighborhood. Relatives carry copper pots with candles or oil lamps on their heads and dance to lively folk songs, filling the air with excitement and community spirit.

### The Wedding Day

- The bride and groom arrive at the Gurdwara in traditional attire.
  - **Groom**: Regal sherwani, adorned turban, and often carries a kirpan, reflecting valor and responsibility.
  - **Bride**: Dressed in red or pink, beautifully adorned with **chooda** (red and white bangles) and **kalire** (golden hanging ornaments tied by her sisters and friends).
- The **Anand Karaj** takes place as sacred hymns called **lavan** are sung, while the couple walks around the Guru Granth Sahib, each round representing a deeper spiritual bond. The atmosphere is serene yet joyful, centered on prayer and unity.

### Post-Wedding

- Following the ceremony, emotions run high as the bride bids farewell to her family during the **vidaai**. She throws puffed rice over her shoulder, symbolizing her gratitude and the blessings she leaves behind. It's a tender, heartfelt moment that marks both an ending and a new beginning.

Sikh weddings are not just about the union of two individuals—they are a beautiful tapestry of love, faith, and community, deeply rooted in centuries-old traditions and spiritual meaning.
