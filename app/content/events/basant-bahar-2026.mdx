## Featured Stories

### Swami Vivekananda: The Modern Prophet

> *"We accept all religions as true."* — World Parliament of Religions, 1893

In 1893, a young monk of 30 delivered a historic address at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago before 7,000 people. His message transcended tolerance, emphasizing **acceptance** and the underlying unity of all humanity.

His speech shattered stereotypes about India, revealing a **fountainhead** of profound spiritual insight. By introducing Vedanta and Yoga to the West, he bridged Eastern and Western philosophies.

Born in Calcutta to an aristocratic family, Vivekananda questioned everything until meeting his guru, **Ramakrishna Paramhansa**. Under his guidance, he studied Eastern and Western philosophies and traveled extensively across India and the West.

### Rani Ahilyabai Holkar: The Philanthropic Queen

> *"True Dharma is in service to others."*

Born May 31, 1725, in Chondi, Central India, Rani Ahilyabai was taught to read and write by her father when girls were barred from formal education. Taking over governance in 1767 after losing her husband, father-in-law and son, she ruled Malwa for 28 years, creating stability and peace.

**Her Legacy:**
- Built wells, tanks and rest houses across India
- Transformed Maheshwar into a literary, musical and artistic center
- Supported religious harmony, building temples, mosques, schools and hospitals
- Facilitated pilgrimage routes from the Himalayas to South India

Every major pilgrimage place in India owes gratitude to her patronage.

## About Dharma

**Dharma (धर्म)** means "duty," "righteousness," or "moral law" — the cosmic principle that upholds the universe. To follow Dharma is to live in alignment with truth, compassion and service to others.

This theme explores how individuals from different eras found their inner calling, overcame barriers, transformed faith into public service, and left lasting legacies of compassion. True Dharma isn't just personal enlightenment — it's using our awakening to serve humanity.
